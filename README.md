# Baas - Bank As A Service

API developed in JavaScript with Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT authentication, CPF, CNPJ and Phone validation of Brazilian users, sends email through Nodemailer, imports PDF files through Multer and Swagger documentation in the OpenAPI 3 specification.

The API creates users, accounts and fictitious bank transactions, retrieves data of users, accounts and transactions recorded in the database, updates data and deletes users (CRUD), according to the user's access profile.

This project is already published on Heroku at https://bank-as-a-service.herokuapp.com/.

All the features of the API are not yet available in the documentation, but by the beginning of next week it will be finalized.

Soon after the end of the documentation, a Front End with React will be developed, for this project to be a complete MERN.

Please contribute to the development of this API, let us know if you encounter problems or have suggestions for improvement.
