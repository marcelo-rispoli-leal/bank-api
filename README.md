# Baas - Bank As A Service

API developed in JavaScript with Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT authentication, CPF, CNPJ and Phone validation of Brazilian users, sends email through Nodemailer, imports PDF files through Multer and Swagger documentation in the OpenAPI 3 specification.

The API creates users, accounts and fictitious bank transactions, retrieves data of users, accounts and transactions recorded in the database, updates data and deletes users (CRUD), according to the user's access profile.

This project is already published on Heroku at https://bank-as-a-service.herokuapp.com/.

A Front End with React will soon be developed, so that this project is a complete MERN.

Please contribute to the development of this API, let us know if you encounter problems or have suggestions for improvement.
